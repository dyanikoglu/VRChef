Alloy 1.01 Change Log
=====================
- Standardized the API naming conventions to avoid name collisions when mixing shader libraries. This will break current user-created shaders, which will need to be updated to use the new API.
  * RimLight() -> aRimLight()
  * EPSILON -> A_EPSILON
  * DeGamma() -> AlloyDeGamma()
  * LinearLuminance() -> AlloyLinearLuminance()
  * etc.

- Added a new material API to move implementation details of our material system out of the individual shaders. 
  * Direct access to the SurfaceOutput will no longer work correctly.
  * For custom shaders, we strongly recommend using the new API.

- The headers are no longer obfuscated, and come fully commented.

- Renamed “Alloy/Transparent/MaskedIncandescence Rim” to “Alloy/Effects/MaskedIncandescence Rim” since it doesn’t integrate with Unity’s translucency system for baking.

- Fixed an issue in “Alloy/Effects/MaskedIncandescence Rim” where it wasn’t getting texture coordinates from the mask texture

- Reoredered the parameters for all the “*MaskedIncandescence*” shaders so that the Mask is higher up to show that it uses the first UV set while the Incandescence texture uses the second UV set.

- Removed an unnecessary energy conserving step from the distort pass of the alpha distort shaders.

- Fixed an issue where alpha was darkening albedo in cutout shaders.

- Fixed an issue in the terrain shaders where the blend weights were being applied twice to the smoothness, causing them to be biased toward rough values where multiple splats overlapped.
